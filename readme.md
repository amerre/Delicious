## What is this?

This is a project that I'm building in the WesBos [course](https://learnnode.com/) focused on nodejs. I'm versioning this repo in order to keep a support where I can refer when I'll build JavaScript full-stack projects.

## What I'm using?

- nodejs
- mongoDB
- Passport
- express
- Sass
- Pug
- Webpack

## Sample Data

To load sample data, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run sample
```

If you have previously loaded in this data, you can wipe your database 100% clean with:

```bash
npm run blowitallaway
```

That will populate 16 stores with 3 authors and 41 reviews. The logins for the authors are as follows:

| Name          | Email (login)      | Password |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Wes Bos       | wes@example.com    | wes      |
| Debbie Downer | debbie@example.com | debbie   |
| Beau          | beau@example.com   | beau     |
